"""The goal of these experiments is to demonstrate RH-UCRL in the RARL setting.

The main idea is to

a) Learn a policy using H-UCRL with a Strong Adversary.
b) Evaluating the policy for learnt level of adversity.
c) Evaluating the policy for different levels of alpha (i.e. re-training the adversary).
